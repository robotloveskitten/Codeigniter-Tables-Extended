A few improvements to Codeigniter's HTML Table library

This library does a few things:
* moves table template into a config file
* allows you to set columns widths
* will auto-generate column classes on cells
* allows you to set row ids

*Table Config*
Basically, this just moves the template array into a config file. I find it more convenient to use and modify this way.

*Setting Column Widths*
You can insert your own class names by setting $this->table->classes to an array of your class names.

*Setting Column Classes*
By setting 'auto_class' (boolean) will auto-generate column classes for table cells: 'c0', 'c1', etc. 

Alternately, you can insert your own class names by setting $this->table->classes to an array of your class names.

Example class name generator (note: # of classes = # of columns in table):

$classes = array();
for($i = 0; $i < count($numberofcolumns); $i++ ) {
	$classes[] = 'c'.$i;
}

*Setting row ids*
When building your arrays of row data, include an element "row_id" => '<your_value>', this will be parsed and inserted as the row id attribute, and deleted from the array before the row cells are generated.
